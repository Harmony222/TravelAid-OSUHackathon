Note that for comunas in Pasos 1 and 2, interregional trips are prohibited.\n*Travel in Chile: If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.\nQuarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. A nationwide curfew (now running between 11pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.\nBe aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government\u2019s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country. Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and caf\u00e9s allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75\u2019s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.\nStage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.

You can leave your home for exercise (including going for a walk) \u2013 but you must remain within one kilometre (extended to 20km from 28 November) of your home and be outside for no longer than one hour (extended to three hours from 28 November).

The attestation is available on the <a href=\"https://mobile.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Attestations-de-deplacement\">Ministry of Interior website,</a> and through the digital app \u2018Tous anti-Covid.\u2019 Travel between regions is not permitted, unless for a reason specified by the government.

Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant.

Parents who stay with their child at the hotel on the first night, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. Further details can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/index.html\">Hong Kong SAR government\u2019s website</a> and you should call the Port Health Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone.\nAll passengers, including departing, arriving and transfer/transit passengers need to wear face masks in all passenger accessible areas of Hong Kong International Airport.

All passengers able to transit Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those passengers not displaying a high temperature will be allowed to connect to their next flight. But passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you will be required to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.\n<br>\n*Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China: All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment. All asymptomatic arrivals ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location. Passengers arriving on morning flights must proceed to the Temporary Specimen Collection Centre located in the Midfield Concourse (MFC) in the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport. You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/holding_centre_en.pdf\">Centre for Health Protection\u2019s website</a>. Children travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333). If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, are required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. \n<br>\n*Quarantine requirements:  Quarantine is usually spent at a hotel, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will also be required to go in to a government quarantine centre.\nFor up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html\">Hong Kong SAR government\u2019s website</a>. For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong: \u2022        you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine; \u2022        if you are allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around HK$200 per night towards the cost; \u2022        items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted.

Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in \u2018essential private services\u2019 are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items.
