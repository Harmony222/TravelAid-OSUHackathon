While only four locations were targeted by these measures, targeted action will be taken to limit movement at popular areas, indicating similar restrictions may be imposed in the coming days. More details on the restrictions can be found on the National Environment Agency’s website.\nSo as to assist in contact tracing, those visiting popular malls and supermarkets are required to provide their contact details, while all workers permitted to enter their workplaces during the circuit-breaker measures are required to use a digital check-in application, SafeEntry. More details on SafeEntry’s deployment at workplaces can be found at the relevant government website.\nIt is mandatory for all to wear masks when in public, except those aged below two years old and those doing vigorous exercises. People who fail to do so will be fined, serious cases will be prosecuted in court.\nAll social gatherings of any size in public and private spaces are banned. Any offence will be punishable by a fine and in certain cases imprisonment. More details of the restrictions are available here.\nAll non-essential 'large-scale' events are cancelled.\nEmployers have been advised to strengthen their business continuity plans, including allowing employees to work from home. Stricter control measures, such as restricting the number of visitors, can also be expected to be imposed at healthcare facilities and schools.\nFrom 5 May, ‘circuit breaker’ measures have been gradually eased; selected work places are permitted to reopen at limited capacity, depending on their level of essentiality. Traditional Chinese Medicine shops were allowed to operate from 5 May. From 12 May onwards, selected businesses such as home-based food operations, food manufacturers, barbers and laundry services will be allowed to resume operations at a limited capacity. There are plans for students to return to school in small groups from 19 May, where graduating cohorts will be prioritised. Social distancing measures will remain in place.",

During this mandatory period following arrival in Spain, leaving home/accommodation will only be possile to shop for food, medications, or other basic necessities, to seek medical assistance, or in other very limited emergency circumstances.\nParliament approved another extension of the ‘state of alarm’ until 21 June.This gives the government emergency powers to impose limitations on movement and impose other extraordinary measures. Countrywide restrictions on movement remain in force and residents have been asked to remain at home except to go to work, to buy food, medicines and other essentials, or in the event of emergencies. However infants under the age of 14 allowed out for one hour. The wearing of facemasks on public transport was made compulsory from 4 May. Hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) are closed. The measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as travellers can cater for themselves and do not rely on communal facilities, which will be closed. \n\n*****Relaxation of restrictions: \nThe gradual relaxation of restrictions began from 4 May, starting with lifting minor restrictions on internal movement. The government is planning to start gradually easing the restrictions as follows. Each autonomous regional government will be able to modify restrictions depending on local realities and all dates remain approximate depending on the evolution of sanitary context. From 4 May, phase 0: appointment based services were allowed to reopen such as hairdressers, dentists, beauty parlours. In the Canary and Balearic islands, phase 1 will start on 4 May unlike the rest of the country (mainland) - see below.

Territories authorised to proceed in phase 1 are listed on the Ministry of Health website. From 25 May, phase 2, theatres, cinemas and other cultural locations will be open to a third of their capacity.

Airline crew who are nationals or residents of Australia must self-isolate at their place of residence (or hotel) between flights, or for 14 days, whichever is shorter.\nAirline crew who are not nationals or residents of Australia must self-isolate in their hotel on arrival until their next flight.\n4. When passengers transit through Australia for 8 to 72 hours, they must go to mandatory quarantine at the state designated facility until the time of the departing flight.\n5. For repatriation charter flights, airlines are advised to contact the Australian Border Force (ABF) as early as possible in the planning process. Airlines should not confirm or schedule flights before discussing arrangements with the ABF repatriation team.\n\nTransit instructions: New Zealanders, citizens of Pacific Island Forum countries, Timor-Leste citizens and residents of New Caledonia or French Polynesia transiting through Australia on their way to New Zealand or a Pacific Island Forum Country do not require a transit exemption if they have booked a connecting flight to depart Australia within 72 hours of their arriving flight.\nThe outbound connecting flight must depart from the same state or territory of Australia as the arrival flight.

Some inter-state travel will be allowed.\nAt stage three, there will be a full resumption of businesses and interstate travel. Gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed.\nFurther details for stages two and three will be announced once the country moves through stage one. Although each state and territories will continue to exercise full autonomy of its own timeline for easing restrictions and moving through the stages, the government aims to reach stage three by July.\nCurrently, interstate travel options remain limited. Queensland’s borders remain closed, with all but freight and essential travel to and from the state banned. Those exempt must apply for an entry pass prior to travel. Inbound Queensland residents with travel history to COVID-19 hot spots declared by the Chief Health Officer must self-quarantine for 14 days.\nWhile several states, including South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, maintain a mandatory 14-day quarantine for domestic arrivals, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Victoria and New South Wales have not imposed such stringent restrictions for interstate travellers. In Western Australia, only exempt travellers are allowed to enter the state, and may be subject to quarantine orders upon arrival.\nNew South Wales: A two-people visitation rule has been implemented to allow two adults to visit another person's home for 'care and support'.

They may also visit people who are not part of their household. Businesses will resume according to these stages. Schools have reopened.\nQueensland: From 16 May, gatherings of up to ten people will be allowed. Restaurants and pubs will reopen.

From 18 May, gatherings of up to ten people will be allowed. Some schools will reopen on 25 May. Metro Tasmania is offering free travel until 31 May. Non-essential businesses are now allowed to reopen, as are schools in north-western Tasmania.\nVictoria: A state of emergency has been extended until 31 May, however some restrictions have been eased. From 12 May, a maximum of five visitors are allowed in one’s household. Gatherings of up to ten people are allowed, on the condition that social distancing measures are maintained. Parks and other recreation facilities have opened, while restaurants remain open for takeaway only. Public transport is operational, though schools remain closed.\nWestern Australia continues to ban non-essential regional travel within the state.

      "info": "Flights and trains canceled as Beijing authorities upgrade emergency response to COVID-19  (Business Standard, 17.06.2020) \n\n1. The mainland of China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into the mainland of China by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits still valid to the time of this announcement, effective from 00:00 local time, 28 March 2020.

A QR code generated from a completed \"Health Declaration Form\" must be presented to immigration upon arrival. The form can be obtained before departure at http://health.customsapp.com/ .\n\n*****Entry restrictions: \nForeigners with visas or residence permits still valid from 28 March are restricted from entering China. This includes foreign nationals with APEC Business Travel Cards, port visas, persons who qualify for 24/72/144-hour visa free transit policies, Hainan 30 day visa-free policy, 15 day visa-free policy specified for foreign cruise-group-tour through Shanghai Port, Guangdong 144-hour visa-free transit policy for foreign tour groups from Hong Kong or Macao Special Administrative Regions and Guangxi 15 day visa-free policies for foreign tour groups from ASEAN countries. Diplomatic, Courtesy or C-Class visas will not be affected. Foreign nationals involved in necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or for emergency and humanitarian needs may also apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.\nMany local governments require inbound travellers to inform their local company office and neighbourhood committee in advance about their travel plan.\nThe number of international passenger flights is reduced. In Beijing, international flights are not landing directly at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK), but are diverted first to other domestic airports in Dalian, Hohhot, Jinan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai Pudong, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Xi’an and Zhengzhou for screening. Travellers will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine at a designated facility upon entry. After clearing the 14-day quarantine, if the traveller enters Beijing after the second day the traveller clears the quarantine, the traveller will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine either at home or a designated facility for 14 additional days.\nAll land border crossings between China and Russia have been closed to travellers. Yunnan province has banned citizens from leaving the country by more than 30 land and river ports at the province’s borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.\nThe Chinese Government is in discussions with foreign governments on \"fast-track\" procedures to allow key employees of foreign companies to return to China. So far, \"fast-track\" commercial charter flights have been arranged with Germany and South Korea and may be extended to other countries in the future.\nAll transit/transfer services, including air transit/transfer, cross boundary land transport and cross boundary ferry transfer, are suspended for all passengers at Hong Kong International Airport.\nResidents with travel history in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do in South Korea, Iran, as well as Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy in the past 14 days will be required upon entry to stay in a quarantine centre for 14 days. Residents with travel history in any other overseas locations in the preceding 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine.\n\n*****Internal restrictions:\nMainland China: Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.\nHubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.\n\nBeijing: Beijing is reintroducing strict lockdown measures and rolling out mass testing after a fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases emerged. (CNN, 15.06.2020) \n\nAs the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to ‘high’ due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. (The Guardian, 19.05.2020) \n\nAnother example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn’t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.\nA new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.\nAs each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.\nAlthough such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:\nA reduction of exit/entry access to the community.\nAccess control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.\nIf there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.\nOn 13 May, Jilin city was announced to be ‘sealed’. Transportations services such as intercity buses and trains for Jilin city are suspended now. People who want to move out of the city need the nucleic acid test within 48 hours of travel and register the information according to official instructions.",

Meanwhile, the government on 14 May lifted the SoE in 39 out of 47 prefectures.\nThe SoE remains in place in the following prefectures: the capital Tokyo,\nChiba (all Kanto region), Hokkaido (Hokkaido region), Hyogo (all Kansai region), Kanagawa, Kyoto, Osaka and Saitama. Earlier, these prefectures were declared ‘special alert’ areas, where measures to contain the pandemic are focused. The measures include school closures and strongly promoting working from home or staggering commuting hours.\nUnder SoE, respective governors are allowed to order the closures of facilities such as schools, cinemas, departments stores as well as ban the gathering of large crowds. Essential services, such as medical facilities, pharmacies, supermarkets, convenience stores, factories, public bathhouses and restaurants, will continue to operate.\nPrior to the announcement of the state of emergency, the authorities had already requested all people to avoid large gatherings and for those already in areas with an uptick in COVID-19 cases to stay inside their homes. While no nationwide directive to cancel events has been issued, event sponsors have been asked to consider whether events are necessary. It is expected that various public events and access to places such as entertainment places, national museums and sports stadiums will be suspended until further notice. \nFrom May 28, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) will reduce the number of regular services on the Tohoku, Joetsu and Hokuriku Shinkansen lines, as well as some standard trains, by as much as 50 percent. (The Mainichi, 20.05.2020)  \n\nRelaxation of restrictions: \nOn May 25, Prime Minister Abe lifted the state of emergency for Hokkaido, Chiba, Saitama, Tokyo, and Kanagawa. The state of emergency has now been lifted for all of Japan.  However, authorities in many prefectures and municipal wards continue to request restricted hours and/or closures of public venues. Local governments have also established roadmaps for reopening schools, businesses and public venues and events, as well as metrics for reinstituting stay-at-home orders should significant second-wave infections occur.
