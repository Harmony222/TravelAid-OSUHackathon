Ban on international flights extended to 31 December; domestic until 15 December (Xinhua, 30.11.2020). Thailand closes 33 border checkpoints with Myanmar (Xinhua , 19.10.2020). 
 <br>
 <br>
 International Restrictions: 
*Entry to Myanmar:  The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 31 December. It will then review the situation. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>
*Testing/Screening on arrival:  There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result.  Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the Myanmar Embassy well in advance of your departure. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The standard quarantine period for new arrivals is 28 days (21 days in a government-arranged facility, followed by 7 days of home quarantine). However, foreign nationals can, through contacting their nearest Myanmar Embassy, request permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. In this case, the quarantine requirements are as follows: 
•        complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test
•        evidence of a negative COVID test result
•        complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival)
•        undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior
The government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight tests positive for COVID-19.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the Myanmar Embassy well in advance of your departure. <br>
*Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.

 <br>
 Internal Restrictions: 
*Travel in Myanmar:  All airlines in Myanmar have suspended their domestic flights until further notice. You should contact individual airlines for details. In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures. All townships in Yangon, except for the Coco Island Region, are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. The rules state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 11pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon. Other parts of Myanmar are also under ’Stay at Home’ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you’re unsure whether an area is subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order should contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel. This guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the <a href=""https://www.mofa.gov.mm/"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> on their website and on their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mofamyanmar/"">Facebook page</a> before you travel inside Myanmar. Further information is also available on the Facebook page for the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthAndSportsMyanmar"">Ministry of Health and Sports. </a> If you’re outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy. Since 13 May it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders. It is recommended that foreigners carry:
•        passport
•        Form C (immigration document)
•        Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
•        Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
•        a copy of your passport information page
•        a copy of your Myanmar visa
•        a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar. <br>
*Accommodation: There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you’re on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa. Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. <br>
*Public places and services:  Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may need customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in public places. The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.

Country reopens to tourists with COVID-19 entry requirements in place (Arabian Business, 06.12.2020). 
 <br>
 <br>
International Restrictions:
*Before you travel:  You must have a valid visa before you travel unless you intend to visit for less than 10 days. Visas cannot currently be issued on arrival. You should check with your airline what documentation they require you to produce. You must complete an online pre-registration <a href=""https://covid19.emushrif.om/traveler/travel"">form</a> prior to departure and have a PCR test on arrival and after 7 days self-isolation. 
You will also need to have downloaded the Tarassud+ and HMushrif track and trace applications (available on iOS and Android phones). While you can do this on arrival in Muscat, you should aim to download it before you depart. When checking in at the airport, residents returning to Oman must present either proof of their accommodation (such as a rental agreement) or have a letter from their sponsor confirming that they have accommodation. Travellers with tourist, business ‘express’ or family visit visas should also have proof of their accommodation. You must also be able to show you have travel/health insurance for the duration of your stay, covering at least 30 days of coronavirus treatment. If you are staying for less than 10 days, in addition to travel/ health insurance, you must also have proof of hotel accommodation and return or onward travel. It is not yet clear what self-isolation requirements must be followed. <br>

 Internal Restrictions:
Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country. The National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City and Tacloban are subject to General Community Quarantine (GCQ) measures. The rest of the Philippines is under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ). However, changes can be made at short notice so you should monitor the status in your local area. Non-essential travel, including for tourist purposes, is now permitted between GCQ and MGCQ regions. There may be entry requirements imposed from region to region so you should check with the relevant local authority. Metro Manila is currently subject to a curfew from midnight-4am with the exception of Navotas City which has curfew hours of 8pm-4am.
Some cities are imposing age restrictions on people permitted to leave their residence for non-essential reasons. These vary by region so you should familiarise yourself with the requirements in your local area.
The wearing of face shields while on public transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.
You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you are situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport.

*Travel in Qatar: Qatar’s <a href=""https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/Coronavirus2019.aspx"">Ministry of Public Health</a> has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Public transport, including the metro and bus services, began running a limited service on 1 September. No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey. It is mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you are outside your home, unless you are alone whilst driving a vehicle or exercising. From 22 May, it is also compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures. Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QR200,000 and a prison sentence not exceeding three years, or one of those two penalties. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels are open, and facilities (ie gyms, pool) have reopened subject to restrictions on capacity. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations. <br>
*Public places and services: Qatar moved to phase 4 of its roadmap for re-opening on 1 September. Parks, beaches, gyms and outdoor swimming pools have reopened, as have malls, some restaurants, museums and libraries, though with varying restrictions on entry, hours and capacity. Gatherings of up to 15 people inside and up to 30 outside can now take place as long as precautionary measures are taken. Mosques and most hairdressers have also reopened, with restrictions, and restaurants have a maximum of four people per table, or up to six from the same household.",20201203,"Self-isolation at own accommodation. 

For all arrivals – including nationals, residents and visa holders – quarantine requirements are now extended for all arrival dates up to 31 December 2020. 
Upon entry to Qatar, you will need to quarantine for a total of 14 days: 7 days in a government approved hotel, at your own expense, followed by a further 7 days self isolation at your home. This will be dependent on the result of your COVID-19 tests. 
For residents returning to Qatar after 29 November, the quarantine period will be for 7 days. For those returning from a country not included on the Qatar Ministry of Public Health’s <a href=""https://covid19.moph.gov.qa/EN/Pages/Countries-Classified-Low-Risk-of-COVID-19.aspx"">‘Green List’</a>, a mandatory 7 day hotel quarantine will apply.

 *Entry to South Korea: South Korea has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders). Foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days are not permitted to enter South Korea. <br>
*Transiting in South Korea: All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>
*Testing / screening on arrival:  All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre. For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals, and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days. All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility; arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for those testing positive. It is worth noting that individuals testing positive on arrival may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before successfully testing negative and being discharged. If you display symptoms or return a positive test result for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

*Data collection: There are very limited exemptions from the self-quarantine system for important – primarily COVID-19 related – business, humanitarian or academic purposes. You must receive approval before you travel from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea where you are. Those with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App. Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.

If you arrived after 21 March 2020, your maximum stay is determined by your visa. If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all foreign nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point.

 *Entry and borders: Upon arrival, all foreign nationals will be required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Whether you have to self-isolate on arrival depends on whether your journey involved travel from or through “red” or “green” zone countries. The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion. 
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine.

Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is not necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine. Further information about taking the tests in Ukraine and terminating self-isolation in case of a negative result can be found via the ‘more detailed’ link of the ‘for citizens of “red zone” countries’ box on the Ukrainian authorities’ <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a>.

*Travel in Chile: If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.
Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. A nationwide curfew (now running between 11pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government’s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country. Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. The Government’s <a href=""https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/coronavirus/cuarentena "">“Chile Atiende” website</a>  outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is in under the first heading (“En qué lugares de Chile hay cuarantena?”).

If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a>.

Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">“Health Passport”</a>  prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly requiring use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces require travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.

*Transit: For external border traffic and to the extent that internal border controls have been restored, a  transit on scheduled routes is permitted. As a rule, during the transit journey, a person must remain in the transit area of the airport, but in exceptional cases, a person may also be permitted to enter the country. For example, a person may stay at a hotel near the airport especially if the waiting time at the airport would be too lengthy (for example, resulting from a cancelled connecting flight). Destination countries may also require passengers to take a coronavirus test at transit airports. Waiting for the test and the test results is not in itself a ground for allowing entry during transit.

 International Restrictions:
*Entry to Hong Kong:  Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days. Spouses and minor children of Hong Kong residents are exempt from the above restrictions. All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus on arrival and will be required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. From 13 November, travellers arriving at Hong Kong International Airport (with the exception of those travelling from mainland China, Macao and Taiwan) will need to provide confirmation of a hotel room reservation in Hong Kong for no less than 14 days, starting on the day of their arrival. Travellers will then be subject to 14 days compulsory quarantine at that hotel. Travellers who have visited these places (i.e. The United States, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Ethiopia, France, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and UK) within the past 14 days, will be required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their departure. You should <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/high-risk-places.html"">check Hong Kong SAR government’s website</a> for important details about the required documents. 
Children travelling alone will also need to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay along at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results. Parents who stay with their child at the hotel on the first night, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. Further details can be found on the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/index.html"">Hong Kong SAR government’s website</a> and you should call the Port Health Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone.
All passengers, including departing, arriving and transfer/transit passengers need to wear face masks in all passenger accessible areas of Hong Kong International Airport. An Air Travel Bubble (ATB) between Hong Kong and Singapore, which was due to launch on 22 November, has been postponed. Further information can be found on the Hong Kong Tourism Commission’s <a href=""https://www.tourism.gov.hk/travel-bubble/en/index.html"">website</a>.

Transiting between flights operated by different airlines is now allowed. Transiting through Hong Kong from, but not to, mainland China is now allowed. You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling and check the <a href=""https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/important-notice/index.page?noticeid=1523424631510-3"">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>. There is a risk you will be placed into 14 days government quarantine. All passengers able to transit Hong Kong International Airport will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those passengers not displaying a high temperature will be allowed to connect to their next flight. But passengers deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If you meet further risk criteria, you will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment, where it is highly likely you will be asked to complete a mandatory COVID-19 test. If you successfully pass health screening you will be required to sit in designated areas at boarding gates and use designated queues in dining facilities and shops, in line with Hong Kong International Airport anti-virus measures.
<br>
*Travel between Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China: All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All passengers wanting to board a shuttle bus to cross the bridge departing from Hong Kong to Macau must present a certificate confirming that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within seven days of their departure. The special ferry service between Taipa Ferry Terminal in Macao and Hong Kong International Airport has now ceased operations. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China are currently not in operation. Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals are also closed to passengers indefinitely. Certain groups of people travelling from mainland China, Taiwan and Macao may be granted an exemption from quarantine requirements by applying in advance to the Chief Secretary of the Administration. These groups include people involved in receiving or providing education and those travelling for purposes relating to manufacturing operations, business activities or the provision of professional services in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development. 
<br>
*Health Declaration form:  All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport are required to submit a health declaration form. 
<br>
*Testing / screening on arrival:  All arrivals (including transit passengers) will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have a high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to a Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment. All asymptomatic arrivals ending their journey at Hong Kong International Airport will have to provide a saliva sample which will be tested for coronavirus. After collecting baggage, travellers will be taken by shuttle bus to the designated location. Travellers will have to wait for test results, before proceeding to their mandatory quarantine location. Passengers arriving on morning flights must proceed to the Temporary Specimen Collection Centre located in the Midfield Concourse (MFC) in the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport. You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/holding_centre_en.pdf"">Centre for Health Protection’s website</a>. Children travelling to Hong Kong on their own must be met by an adult for checking in to the HCTR whilst they await test results. Please contact the Port Health Authority for the latest guidance (+852 3904 9333). If the sample tests positive, the Hong Kong authorities will notify you and arrange for admission to a public hospital. All arrivals, including those who test negative for coronavirus, are required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. 
<br>
*Quarantine requirements:  Quarantine is usually spent at a hotel, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will also be required to go in to a government quarantine centre.
For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html"">Hong Kong SAR government’s website</a>. For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong: •        you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine; •        if you are allocated a government quarantine centre, you may be asked to contribute around HK$200 per night towards the cost; •        items that can be taken in to government quarantine are restricted. There is no smoking allowed and no alcohol. Depending on your centre, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge and no air-conditioning; •        you will be issued with a bluetooth-enabled wristband which will be activated at the airport and linked to a mobile app ‘StayHomeSafe’ on your phone. The bluetooth-enabled wristbands will alert the authorities if the wearer leaves their registered address with or without their phone. Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in you being immediately taken to government quarantine facilities. You could face a 6-month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.

On 15 September, the Irish Government published a plan for <a href=""https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/covidplan/"">‘Living with COVID-19’</a>   in the 6-9 months covering the end of 2020 and early 2021.
The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19. From 1 December, Ireland will move to <a href=""https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad569-level-3/"">Level 3</a>. There will be further changes taking place later in December. Table taken from the Irish Government website. <a href=""https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad569-level-3/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/level3/"">Visit the Irish Government website</a> for more information on these measures. The link also includes detail on Level 3 measures not included in the table, such as: social gatherings; organised events (e.g. sporting events, weddings and funerals); work; schooling, pre-schooling and higher education; outdoor playgrounds and parks; transport; long-term residential facilities; and guidance for over-70s.  <br>
*Face coverings:  The Irish government now recommends that face coverings are worn in crowded workplaces, places of worship and in busy or crowded outdoor spaces where there is significant congregation. For more information on exemptions and a complete list of settings where wearing a face covering is required, please see the <a href=""https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/aac74c-guidance-on-safe-use-of-face-coverings/"">Irish Government</a> website.
