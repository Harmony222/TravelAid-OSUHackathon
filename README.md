·       With COVID-19 restricting travel in many countries, it’s difficult to decide if/where to travel this summer. Most countries are slowly opening their borders with different rules about travel.
·       TravelAid is a web app where you can find all the travel information/restrictions for each country in one place as well as flight options and pricing from your location to the country of your choice.
